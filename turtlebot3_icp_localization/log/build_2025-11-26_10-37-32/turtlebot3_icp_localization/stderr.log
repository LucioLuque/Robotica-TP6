[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /home/luqo/miniforge3/envs/ros_env/share/pcl-1.13/PCLConfig.cmake:143 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable EIGEN_ROOT is set to:

    /home/luqo/miniforge3/envs/ros_env/include/eigen3

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
